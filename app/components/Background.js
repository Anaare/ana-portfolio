      <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
      <p>
        I have an MBA in Finance and have worked in that field for over 10
        years. But two years ago, I decided to challenge myself with something
        completely new — web development. I love turning designs into
        responsive, working code. In my free time, I enjoy long walks with
        overpriced coffee ☕ around Tbilisi 🇬🇪. My goal is to become a remote
        developer and explore the world 🌍.
