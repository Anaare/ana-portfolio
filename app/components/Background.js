        After over a decade in the business world (and more spreadsheets than I
        can count), I discovered the magic of web development: making beautiful
        designs come to life with code. I build responsive, accessible
        interfaces using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS â€” and I&apos;m always
        learning more. When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll probably find me
        walking around Tbilisi with overpriced coffee in hand, dreaming about my
        next remote coding spot with a sea view.
